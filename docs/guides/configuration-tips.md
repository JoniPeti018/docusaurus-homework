# SmartHome Control System Configuration Tips

Optimize your SmartHome Control System setup with these configuration tips:

## 1. Environment Variables

Proper configuration of environment variables is key to ensuring your SmartHome Control System operates smoothly. Here's how to set them up:

* **API_KEYS**: Store API keys for third-party integrations (e.g., weather services, IoT devices).

  ```bash
  export API_KEY_WEATHER="your_weather_api_key"
  export API_KEY_IOT="your_iot_api_key"
  ```
* **DB_CONFIG**: Define database connection strings.

  ```bash
  export DB_HOST="localhost"
  export DB_PORT="5432"
  export DB_USER="smarthome_user"
  export DB_PASS="secure_password"
  ```
* **DEBUG_MODE**: Enable or disable debug mode for troubleshooting.

  ```bash
  export DEBUG_MODE="true"
  ```

## 2. Common Pitfalls and Solutions

Avoid these common issues to keep your system running smoothly:

* **Incorrect API Keys**:
  Ensure the API keys are accurate and match the corresponding services. Double-check environment variables for typos.
* **Device Connectivity Issues**:
  If devices fail to connect, verify your network configuration and ensure the correct protocols (e.g., MQTT, HTTP) are enabled.
* **Database Connection Failures**:
  Check if the database service is running and the credentials are correct. Use tools like `pg_isready` for PostgreSQL to validate connectivity.

## 3. Advanced Configurations

Maximize your system's capabilities with these advanced settings:

* **Custom Scheduling Rules**:
  Create personalized automation routines using CRON expressions.

  ```json
  {
    "routine_name": "Morning Lights",
    "trigger": "0 7 * * *",
    "action": "turn_on",
    "device_id": "light_living_room"
  }
  ```
* **Dynamic Energy Saving Modes**:
  Integrate with power usage APIs to adjust device consumption during peak hours automatically.

  ```python
  if energy_usage > threshold:
      system.set_energy_saving_mode(True)
  ```
* **Voice Command Extensions**:
  Extend voice assistant functionality by adding custom phrases and actions.

  ```yaml
  - command: "Turn on the party mode"
    actions:
      - lights.set_color("multi")
      - music.play_playlist("party_hits")
      - thermostat.set_temp(22)
  ```

By applying these configurations, you can ensure that your SmartHome Control System operates efficiently and provides a seamless, user-friendly experience.
